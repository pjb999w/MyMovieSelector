# MyMovieSelector
Java project for calculating the number of personal pronouns used in a selected movie

The Uibooster library creates the dialogue for the sketch. ‘movieListMenu’ and ‘characterMenu’ were used as selection menus. The ‘Table’ function held the information from the movie_titles_metadata_header.csv and movie_lines_header.csv files. The ‘String’ variable holds the string from the movie list menu, holds the movie ID associated with the selection in the drop down list and selects a character from the menu. An ‘ArrayList’ provides a means of approaching and searching content so that, where an item such as a character name may be listed several times in the csv file, it only appears once in the dropdown menu. ‘loadTable’ incorporates data from csv files to fill the movie list and movie lines tables. The command ‘getRowCount’ determines the number of rows in each table and, thereby, the size of the dropdown menus, ‘println’ executes this command. ‘newString’ generates the ‘movieOptions’ array that holds the names of all the movies. ‘Select your favourite movie’ is the question used to select a movie from the movie list. ‘Characters from’ + slectedMovieName forms the title of a window that allows the user to select a character. ‘if’ and ‘getString’ display data associated with the chosen character. ‘println’ prints a characters dialogue and the number of personal pronouns they use. The last piece of code in the sketch constructs a pie chart showing the percentage of a characters dialogue that includes personal pronouns.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118185253/201671122-34087686-6390-4b9b-ab92-5e0d0b1d7306.png)
